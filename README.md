Scripts for Mysql Workbench
------------

MySQLWorkbench allows to design database model easily and also provides an option to generate the SQL script.   By default script is generated for MySQL, but, what if you need to generate a SQL script for FirebirdSQL?.

Using Python you cand create custom plugins to access to model properties  (table and columns definitions for example) please visit this link for more info Scripting and Plugin Development

So, I decided to write a plugin to generate a SQL Script for FirebirdSQL. My goal it's just to show how can we access to schemas, tables and columns properties using classes already defined by MySQLWorkbench.
